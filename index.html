                            You start by changing your code in a small way.<br/>
                            How small ?<br>
                            Well, very small, for example you can:<br/>
                            change the operator or a value in a mathematical equation,<br/>
                            replace one variable with another,<br/>
                            duplicate a statement,<br/>
                            change the boolean operators,<br/>
                            etc., etc.<br/>
                            So the changes should be similar to small programming errors that each of us do.

                            After that, you run your tests and see what happens. There are two possibilities here.<br/>
                            You start getting errors, which means that tests have reached the modified code and:<br/>
                            - either they died with some error message, because they didn't expect this modification in the code. For example your function was expecting 2 parameters but suddenly it got only one and that kills your test. This situation is called "weak mutation testing" and it means that your tests are good and in case something changes, you will notice it.<br/>
                            - or your tests detects the change properly and informs you about it with the assertion failure - which means that your tests are even better. This situation is called strong mutation testing and it's more powerful - it means that tests are actually catching the possible problems, but it's also more difficult to achieve this.

                            Well, it usually means bad things:<br/>
                            - either you tests didn't detect the problems that were introduced during the mutation (so your tests are bad),<br/>
                            - or the code that was changed was never executed (so you have dead code, which is even worse than bad tests)

                            After all the possible mutations have been tested, you will get the mutation score, which is equal to the number of mutants killed divided by the total number of mutants created.<br />
                            So here, instead of having 100% of test coverage (as for normal tests), we aim to have 100% of mutants killed.

                            Right, you can replace the multiplication operator with the addition operator (or even with the power operator) and this test will still pass.<br/>If you run a mutation testing tool, it will try to replace multiplication operators with various other operators or statements.<br/>
                            If the tool is good, it should detect the mutant that survived and inform you about that.

                            Let me show you an example. Take a look at this simple loop that does some stuff and then increments the index.<br />
                            When we reach 10, we want to break.<br />
                            Now, the mutation tests can replace the equal operator with greater or equal.<br/>
                            We can easily tell that even though the syntax is different, both versions of this loop will have exactly the same behavior.<br />
                            However, automatic tools are not as clever as we are. They will see a different syntax that has not been detected by any of the tests and give us a false positive.

                        What could be the advantages of automatic mutation testing tools ?<br/>
                        They can help you detect problem with your tests<br/>
                        But they can also help you detect problems with your code, like dead code<br/>
                        They are automatic.<br/>
                        And let's face it - how else would you measure the quality of your tests ?<br/>
                        We have code coverage statistics for the code, but we don't have anything like that for tests.<br/>
                        So, if there is a good tool, that I could plug into my continuous integration cycle that would report problems with my test, then I'm totally sold.<br/>
                        Studies shows that software developers spend up to 50% of their time just on testing. I would love to have a tool that gives me automatic feedback on my tests.<br/>

                        And that bring us to the "not so good parts".<br/>
                        First of all - mutation testing is slow. If you think that your whole test suite is slow because it runs for 2 minutes, then imagine that proper mutation testing requires running all your tests for the all the mutants. Well, there are some studies on how to speed up this process, like using selective mutations or mutant sampling, but they all boil down to running less tests and that might overlook some bugs.<br/>
                        There are not so many good libraries for mutation testing.<br/>
                        This is often caused by the aforementioned Equivalent Mutant Problem, which is very difficult to solve.<br/>
                        Also, writing complex tests, beyond the simple operator changing or variables replacement, it's basically impossible.
